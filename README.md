# Human Resource Data Analysis
HR analytics, also referred to as people analytics or workforce analytics, involves gathering, analyzing, and reporting HR data. It enables your organization to better understand your workforce, measure the impact of a range of HR metrics on overall business performance, and make decisions based on data. In other words, HR analytics is a data-driven approach to Human Resources Management.
HR analytics allows HR professionals to make informed decisions and create strategies that will benefit employees and support organizational goals. This has a significant impact on organizational performance, leading to as much as a 25% rise in business productivity, a 50% decrease in attrition rates, and an 80% increase in recruiting efficiency.
